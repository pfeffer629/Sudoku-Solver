Input: string of integers and dashes (81 chars)
Output: string of integers (81 chars)

1. Create board (#print_board)
  - Split every nine chars into a row

2. Find next empty cell (i.e a dash)
  - #next_empty_cell

  3. Look at related sets to empty cell
    - Row (#get_row)
    - Column (#get_column)
    - Box (#get_box)

  4. Find cell possibilities
    - Find existing integers (#existing_nums)
      a. For each char, if it's not a dash, add it to an array
    - Find numbers not used yet (#nums_not_used)
      a. take a default array of 1-9 and delete existing nums from it
    - These methods are applied to #get_row .. column .. box

  5. Check if there is a unique solution for the cell
    - Check next number in #nums_not_used
      a. if the number doesn't conflict, move to next cell
      b. if there is a conflict go back and use next number from #nums_not_used

  6. Continue at step 2 with next cell
